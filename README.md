# Collection Updates

This React app pulls the latest updates to my CD collection from Discogs. I've been collecting CDs for about 6 months as of now
and I wanted to document the latest that I've gotten. I'm utilizing the Discogs API to get the information, specicically
[this one](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:user-collection,header:user-collection-collection-items-by-folder). 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
