# Collection Updates

This React app pulls the latest updates to my CD collection from Discogs. I've been collecting CDs for about 6 months as of now
and I wanted to document the latest that I've gotten. I'm utilizing the Discogs API to get the information, specicically
[this one](https://www.discogs.com/developers/#page:user-collection,header:user-collection-collection-items-by-folder).

## To do

There's a rate limit on the API to get images, which was something I wanted to do to add some images to the collection.
Unfortunately, I don't know an easy way for me to get them, so for the time being the site will remain like this until
I can find a way to add them.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
